I started getting interested in drawing about three to four years ago, and at first I was only getting the courage to draw a few times every couple months. Since I wasn't really practising all that much I wasn't seeing any growth in my drawings and I was getting a little frustrated with myself. I had to ask myself what was holding me back from picking up a piece of paper and pencil and just drawing a little more often? I knew why I wasn’t getting better but I didn't understand what was holding me back. After I thought about it for a while (a long while) I started to understand that I essentially had an outlook that since I wasn't drawing masterpieces then what was the point of even doing it. 

I wasn't actively telling myself that I was a bad artist or that I should give up, but I did realize what was giving me so much doubt in myself. I also wasn't appreciating the work that I was creating. I then took the time to look back through my old pictures and really take in that my small simple drawings were huge accomplishments that were leading to bigger goals, and that makes them masterpieces.

It is so refreshing to stop putting pressure on myself and admit that my drawings were bad-ass even if they weren't realistic portraits or beautiful landscapes. My Drawings are magnificent because I created them, and to be honest it feels pretty good to praise my talents after criticizing them for so long. Once I stopped putting so much pressure on myself I really started feel like I was making progress with my drawings. Certain cartoons I can draw faster now and some even from memory. This is a huge accomplishment because for the first time since I’ve been drawing I can see and feel myself getting better and there is no better feeling than that.
